<p> So I'm pretty sure we don't really need to worry about endpoints </p>
<p> At least, we can deliver files, such as text, html, and images without directly interfacing with endpoints, using only the httpserver::file_response function. It's actually stupidly easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>class file_resource : public httpserver::http_resource
<br>{
<br>public:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::string content_path;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::string content_type;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//constructor
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file_resource(std::string i_path, std::string i_type): content_path(i_path), content_type(i_type){}
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const std::shared_ptr<httpserver::http_response> render_GET(const httpserver::http_request&)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return std::shared_ptr<httpserver::file_response>(new httpserver::file_response(content_path, 200, content_type));
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br> };

<p> This page exists using just the above class, a single .txt being interpreted as html, and a few images that are also registered using the same class <br>
There may be some value in endpoints for measuring throughput, but I suspect there's probably a simpler solution for that as well</p>
